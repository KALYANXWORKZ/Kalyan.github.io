        In this article, we will know the HTML Paragraph, 
        & its basic implementation through the examples. The 
             tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening 
             and closing tags. So anything mentioned within and 
              is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as
               a paragraph even if we dont use the closing tag i.e, 
            , but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is both a 
            good convention, and we must use the closing tag.
